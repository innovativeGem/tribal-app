# Tribal App

Created an app to output a menu to select a person based on their gender and list down all their pets.

### Tech

* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - fast node.js network app framework
* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/install) - CSS preprocessor 

### Installation

Open Terminal/Command prompt on your system.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/innovativeGem/tribal-app.git
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ ng build
```


### Accomplishment

As per the project brief, i have achieved following 
- Added a menu to list all people based on their gender.
- When user selects a person, app lists down all their pets based on their type and name.
- Added 2 child components namely Menu and Pets
- Loaded Mock JSON data into my application.
- Created a Service to load JSON data.
- Make app responsive using SCSS and Bootstrap.
- Unit tested my application without any errors.
- I have taken few screenshots of my work and placed it in root assets directory
([App Screenshot 1](../../blob/master/src/assets/tribal-app-screenshot-1.png), [App Screenshot 2](../../blob/master/src/assets/tribal-app-screenshot-2.png), [App Screenshot 3](../../blob/master/src/assets/tribal-app-screenshot-3.png), [App Screenshot 4](../../blob/master/src/assets/tribal-app-screenshot-4.png), [Karma Unit Tests](../../blob/master/src/localhost-9876--id=45421272.png))

### Hick-up
- Had to creat mocked JSON as linking to http://test.stage.tribalddbmelb.com.au/  showed an error saying 'No Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header ([Click here for error message](../../blob/master/src/assets/error-json.png)).
